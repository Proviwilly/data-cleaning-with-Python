# data-cleaning-with-Python

##  Project Overview  
This project focuses on **data cleaning** using Python to prepare raw, messy data for analysis. The dataset was processed by handling missing values, correcting text formatting, converting data types, and creating new columns to enhance data usability.  

##  Key Techniques Used  
- **Text Cleaning:**  
  - Used `str.split()` to split text data.  
  - Applied `str.title()` to convert text into proper case (capitalizing each word).
  - Department column was split into Department and Region 
- **Data Type Conversion:**  
  - Converted columns to their respective data types (e.g., strings, integers, floats, dates).  
- **Handling Missing Values:**  
  - Filled, replaced, or removed null values to maintain data integrity.  
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Created new columns to improve the dataset’s quality.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** 📊  
- **NumPy** 🔢  
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓
